# The JJ Fund

## About JJ

**James Johnson (JJ)** (1952–2024) was a senior software developer at the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute at the University of Minnesota.

JJ was one of the earliest software developers to start using Galaxy and became a rock star in the Galaxy Proteomics community starting in 2014. He contributed in many ways to the growth of Galaxy, which is now used by thousands of people worldwide to advance a wide variety of research projects. JJ developed numerous Galaxy tools and workflows that continue to benefit researchers today, contributing significantly to Galaxy's ToolShed, the Intergalactic Tools Commission, and workflow development.

JJ attended most Galaxy community conferences, including the very first one and GCC 2022. He is featured in the Galaxy Training Network Hall of Fame for his contributions to training and education. JJ always had a heart for training and mentoring students and other researchers who were new to Galaxy—everyone was seeking him out during the Galaxy Community Conferences.
