>
> valé James.
>
> *Jim Proctor, University of Dundee*

> A great visionary and a lovely person too. We are all shocked and saddened. Such a loss to us all. Thoughts are with his family and friends.
>
> *Carole Goble, University of Manchester*

> James was so approachable. Though we never got the chance to collaborate directly, when I first met *the* James Taylor I remember feeling that approachability in that someone so famous in our field would always take the time out to talk to me about science or about whatever the topic of the moment was. We had many conversations - some just a glance across a busy crowd at a conference where that would be our only acknowledgement, some, hours long chats. The first memory that came to mind thinking back now was the many weeks he spent at CSHL instructing at courses in the fall. There were months when he was on campus more than I was. The particular memory that flashed when I heard this news was finishing a beer with him around 2 am in the cold outside the bar at Blackford. The bar had long closed, but we were having a crazy conversation along with one other course instructor about awful American TV shows. The conversation was of course punctuated with thoughts on comparative genomics. James was brilliant, but it wasn’t this that made him a star, helped him build a global community, or an enduring vision. He was a lovable and decent human being who will be fondly remembered. His work and the community he helped to create will live on. For every researcher who continues his legacy and works to live up to his achievements, don’t forget to bring along also his charm, curiosity, compassion, and love.

> *Jason Stajich, UC Riverside*

> I was fortunate to be introduced to James via the IU/TACC Jetstream project, where he promised to consume large quantities of CPU time on behalf of the Galaxy project. His vision and his plans for achieving it were both straightforward and clear. In short: Give us a key to your system (an API key, in this case), and we will make sure it's used for good. And he delivered, spectacularly! While this straightforward approach might at first appear naive, he articulated his plans clearly and proved soundly that he could do it. He was always ready to share examples of discoveries that had been enabled by Galaxy. In later visits on other topics, I was impressed by his astute understanding of how the research community works and how to make (important, substantive) things happen. People like him are rare and special, and a joy to encounter and work with. This is a heavy loss for the research community.
>

> James was a great force for openness, community, and science. He was a truly lovely man. I first met him in Oslo in 2013 and he was immediately welcoming even though he had no idea who I was. Over the years that followed we shared beers, meals, conversations, games and laughs. The thing I'll most remember about him is the glint of pride he got in his eye whenever he saw the wonderful Galaxy community get together. He and Anton created something amazing.

> *CSHL Courses*

> We are deeply saddened by the loss of a wonderful person that was part of our CSHL courses family for many years. Im just heartbroken with the news. We will miss you Dr. Taylor, thank you for all your kindness. It was an honor working with you.
>
> *Alicia Vanessa Franco*

> As I write this from Colombo, Sri Lanka, one can only think of the impact that James has had across the entire world at such a young age, and how his untimely loss has taken away so much from it. The software and community that James was a chief architect of, has positively affected hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world. The loss felt by all of us in this vibrant, welcoming world-wide community that he helped to create, cannot be captured in words. Rest in peace James, the community and impact you have created will live on in your name.

>
> *Mallory Freeberg, EMBL-EBI*

> I am a researcher in Genetics, and took a series of Coursera Genomic Analysis courses, in which Prof. Taylor was the instructor. As a teacher I am passing on what I learned there, and by coincidence this week I am teaching an on-line version of his course for students and researchers at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, helping us to have some intellectual activity during this quarentine. Two or three days ago I was reviewing some of his lectures !!! That is a real global influencer. We are here in Rio de Janeiro in the middle of a crisis, and still we are learning from his. I thank him a lot.
>

>
> *Christopher Ne Ville, CSUSB*

> I'm so sorry to hear this. James' influence and work has enabled so many people and discoveries, and will continue to do so for many years to come. We share your loss and our thoughts are with you all.
>
> *Leighton Pritchard, University of Strathclyde*

> I met James over five years ago though the Galaxy Community, and I believe that his personality and role as co-founder helped shape that positive and welcoming atmosphere. Looking back it is clear that he and Anton convinced funders of the importance of community building, evident in how the Galaxy Project funded and has continued to fund dedicated staff for community, outreach and training. James cared both about people and principles - he was also vocal on open science and open data, embodied in the Galaxy platform's ethos of reproducible research. Just days ago, he was tweeting complaints about how in a pandemic so much new covid19 viral sequence data was not being shared openly (as in the NCBI/INSDC), but instead under restricted terms in the GISAID database. It is clear from the posts of his students, mentees, collaborators and friends, that while he would have achieved much more, he has already built a legacy we can all be proud of.
>
> *Peter Cock, James Hutton Institute*

> I'm just a citizen scientist active in human genome analysis especially regarding Y-DNA J2 and ancestral and relatives haplotype clusters. I cheer and am thankful of public science services like Galaxy Project and hereby would like to send my thanks to James Taylor et al for what they provided to every interested person.
>
> *Chris R., Tyrol, Alps*

> I am heartbroken. When I think of James I remember him relaxing in the sun during one of the GCC hackathons. At the time I was attending as a lowly delegate from Africa, and engaging with a Galaxy project PI was quite a leap. We got talking and got to know each other over meetings and beers over the years. I cannot believe he is gone. His family and friends are left with a gaping hole in their lives. My strength to you (us) all. Sincere condolences to James' family and everyone in the Galaxy community from SANBI and myself.

![Laptop Stickers][6]

> I remember James as embodying an uncompromising commitment to community-driven science to the point of making it feel like a family; how do we help each other to move science forward. It was noticeable in each conversation we had and this imprint he made will always stick with me. When you stop and think about how much scientific progress was made because he had a strong hand in breaking down silos and building global bridges, that impact is both lasting and expanding.
>
> *Anushka Brownley, 10X Genomics*

> I never knew James personally but I just wanted to say that I saw him from afar many times during my academic career and he was always surrounded by laughing and joy. We will not soon forget the joy and spirit he left with us all.
>
> *Matt Velinder, University of Utah*

>James was an incredibly kind teacher and friend. You could tell he was truly passionate about teaching and building others up around him. He cared deeply for his students and was willing to invest in anyone who wanted help. It was clear he was truly passionate about making computational tools and skills accessible to as many people as possible and I suspect that this will be one of his greatest gifts to the world.
>
>I still remember going up to James during one of his lectures and expressing that I was skeptical of many of the available bioinformatic tools. I was a bit shocked when he replied, "You should be incredibly skeptical. You should use most of them and trust none of them." I really admired this intellectual honesty, how he was able to teach and rely on many tools while still being highly objective and critical of them. That is something I will always remember about him and carry with me as a guiding principle in the years to come.
>One of the privileges of being an academic is the opportunity to meet truly remarkable people, those who not only possess incredible intelligence but also incredible character. James was undoubtedly one of those individuals and his passing is a true loss.

> I met James in November 2002 at an open-source software conference. He was working professionally as a software developer and was speaking of his desire to go back to school to study bioinformatics. I’ve watched his career from afar as he’s done amazing work. I know he will be missed.

> I am feeling a deep sadness knowing that a true scientist has passed away. I have not met Dr Taylor, but I felt him like my friend I learnt a lot from his participation in Galaxy and online courses and I am sure his legacy will never ever be forgotten. My condolences to his family and colleagues.

> James was so helpful to various projects I've been involved in over the years. and lately he was a valuable voice of technical and educational experience in various NIH-driven projects. Beyond his obvious talent as a scientist, and a supportive colleague, he was a thoughtful and considerate person. It was always a pleasure to work with him. My thoughts go out to his family, trainees, close colleagues, and the entire community on this terrible loss.

> *Debashis Ghosh, University of Colorado, Denver*

> Community building is so hard and so important. If we are talking about sustainability, this almost ever means to maintain and grow a community. Galaxy will be soon 15 years old. You and your team did it! Thanks for everything that you have given us James. I will miss you.

> The world of genomics, bioinformatics, and to a great extent, current biology has lost a pioneer. Galaxy has been there for almost a decade and a half and was so ahead of its time. Your work has advanced science significantly and will be carried on. RIP & condolences to family.

> This is truly very sad, my deepest condolences to his family, friends and to the Galaxy community. I had the chance of meeting James briefly during the last GCC, a very nice person and true advocate of open science and open source. RIP James.

> I met James at a Galaxy Community developers conference in the first year of my PhD and was taken aback by how friendly he and his team were and welcoming to all as equals. A great admirer and user of his work and saddened by this loss.
>
> *Craig Monger, Trinity College Dublin*

> Your kind words about James bring tears. Our family thanks you all.
>
> *Laurie Taylor Gates*

> It's been a couple weeks now, and I still feel like it is so surreal that this could have happened. I didn't know James super well but he will always be the voice I hear announcing the state of the Galaxy during the community conference. He had a hand in so many initiatives and was so central to the communities I'm a part of, I'm left wondering how the world will possibly go on without his leadership.
