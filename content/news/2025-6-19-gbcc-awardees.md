[JXTX: The James P. Taylor Foundation for Open Science][1] and the JJ Travel Fellowship are pleased to announce the recipients of the 2025 Galaxy and Bioconductor Community Conference (GBCC) Scholarships. The JXTX Foundation provides support for students to attend conferences in computational biology and data science, where they can present their work and form connections with other researchers in the field.

Seven outstanding graduate students and postdoctoral researchers from around the globe were awarded JXTX and JJ Fund scholarships. These awardees will present their work at the [Galaxy and Bioconductor Community Conference 2025][2] being held July 7-11. Awardees represent diverse institutions and are presenting a wide range of research at the meeting.

<h3>Negin Kafee Hernashki</h3>
<h4>University of Milan</h4>

Negin Kafee Hernashki is originally from Kerman, Iran. She holds a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology from Yazd University and earned her first Master's in Bioinformatics from the University of Wolverhampton, UK. She is currently pursuing a second Master's degree in Bioinformatics for Computational Genomics at the University of Milan, Italy, where her focus is on applying AI and machine learning to disease prediction and prevention. Her recent work includes predictive modeling for Alzheimer's disease using multi-modal data and publications on vaccine candidate discovery. She is a recipient of an excellence scholarship in Italy and was a professional fencer on the Iranian national team for 17 years.

<h3>Mirela Minkova</h3>
<h4>Utrecht University</h4>

Mirela is a first-year Bioinformatics Master's student at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. She discovered her passion for bioinformatics during a project focused on prostate cancer analysis using Galaxy, leading her to pursue internships developing Galaxy workflows for cardiomyopathy patients. Her Bachelor's thesis work on Galaxy was nominated for best thesis. She currently works with SURF Research Cloud deploying secure Galaxy and Pulsar instances for Dutch researchers, while also doing an internship at UMCU developing a classifier for pediatric brain cancer.

<h3>Nitin Narwade</h3>
<h4>Institute of Neurosciences, Alicante, Spain</h4>

Nitin is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Institute of Neurosciences, Alicante, Spain. His research focuses on understanding the role of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in cancer progression. During his PhD, he identified two distinct cancer cell evolutionary trajectories during EMT-dependent cancer progression: one activating an inflammatory, anti-tumoral response, and the other promoting an invasive, pro-tumoral program that facilitates metastatic dissemination. His current project investigates how different stromal cells interact with tumor cells in an EMT-dependent manner and how these interactions influence cancer progression.

## About JXTX: The James P. Taylor Foundation for Open Science

"The most important job of senior faculty is to mentor junior faculty and students." These are the words that Professor [James P. Taylor][3], the Ralph S. O'Connor Professor at the Departments of Biology and Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University said and lived by. This, he believed, was imperative to advance science, and in a way that facilitated diversity and inclusion. The mission of this foundation is to continue his legacy, through a multifaceted approach which will be unrolled across several stages.

Towards the goal of advancing mentorship, the JXTX Foundation will organize and host mentoring sessions between senior and junior faculty members at select high-profile meetings. The Foundation also aims to attract new scholars, including high school and undergrad students, to computational biology and data science, and to form connections and opportunities for members of underrepresented minority populations.

## About the James Johnson (JJ) Travel Fellowships

The JJ Travel Fellowships help bring new contributors into the Galaxy ecosystem while honoring JJ's legacy as a contributor and mentor in the Galaxy and University of Minnesota communities. James Johnson, or JJ as he was better known, worked as a senior software developer at the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute at the University of Minnesota and was one of the earliest software developers to start using Galaxy. JJ always had a heart for training and mentoring students and other researchers who were new to Galaxy.

According to his colleagues, James hated self-promotion. But the community would be done a grave disservice if the seeds planted by Dr. Taylor were not nourished to grow and flourish. Thank you to those who have generously contributed to both foundations.

Please consider making a donation to support [James Taylor's legacy][4] and the [JJ Travel Fellowships][5].
