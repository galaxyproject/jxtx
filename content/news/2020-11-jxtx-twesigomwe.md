# David Twesigomwe on the impact of the JXTX Foundation

*David participated in Biological Data Science 2020*

November 20th 2020

The [JXTX Foundation's][1] first activity was to [sponsor 10 graduate students to attend the 2020 Biological Data Science Conference][2] at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Awards were competitive and we were delighted with our first round of participants.

[David Twesigomwe][3], a scholarship awardee and a PhD candidate in Human Genetics at the [Sydney Brenner Institute for Molecular Bioscience][4] at the [University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg][5] benefited greatly from his participation:

> The JXTX Foundation Scholarship gave me the opportunity to attend the 2020 CSHL Biological Data Science Meeting ([#biodata20][6] - virtual), a timely conference given my current PhD work involving building reproducible pipelines for calling star alleles in Cytochrome P450 genes. Even though the conference was virtual, I am really glad to have interacted with fellow young researchers from around the world, broadening my perspectives in the process. By far, my best part of #biodata20 was meeting one-on-one with four incredible genomics and data science researchers, courtesy of being a JXTX scholarship awardee. Although the mentorship sessions lasted only 30 minutes, I felt like I had been blessed with career and life-long mentors. All the mentors left the door open for further guidance, advice and perhaps even future collaboration. Having presented a [poster][7] at the conference, I have also benefitted from continued discussions about my research via the meeting slack workspace. Overall, the #biodata20 meeting is one of the best things that have happened to me in a challenging 2020. I would like to thank my supervisors, colleagues, JXTX mentors and above all the JXTX Foundation for making this experience possible.

Please help further the careers of junior researchers by making a contribution to [JXTX: The James P. Taylor Foundation for Open Science][1].
