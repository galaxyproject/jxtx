# Elysia Chou

**University of Michigan**

Elysia is a Bioinformatics PhD candidate at the University of Michigan and is mentored by Dr. Maureen Sartor. Her current research focuses on pinpointing cell type-specific gene regulatory mechanisms in psoriasis by building computational tools to link disease-associated variants or cis-regulatory elements to their target genes. Her methods have allowed her to work with a wide range of epigenomic data, from multimodal single cell ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq to bulk eQTL.

Outside of research, Elysia leads the University of Michigan's chapter of Girls Who Code, where her team seeks to address local technology education inequities by providing a supportive and collaborative environment for high schoolers to learn how to code.
