# Irika Sinha

**Johns Hopkins School of Medicine**

Irika Sinha is a fourth-year PhD candidate in the Neuroscience Training Program at Johns Hopkins University, advised by Dr. Philip Wong and Dr. Jonathan Ling. As an undergraduate, she was involved in research across various fields and ultimately developed a strong interest in neurodegeneration and bioinformatics.

Recently, Irika has focused on investigating TDP-43-associated alternative splicing in neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the increasing amount of large datasets becoming available across all fields, she is especially excited to attend the CSHL Biological Data Science meeting to learn about the methods being used and developed to rigorously analyze these data. Outside of research, Irika can be found rockclimbing or lifting.
