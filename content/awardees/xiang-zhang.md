# Xiang Zhang

**University of Minnesota Twin Cities**

Xiang Zhang is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota, advised by Dr. Chad Myers. He specializes in using machine learning approaches for integrating diverse genomic data to make inferences about biological networks. His recent focus has been developing computational methods for mapping and interpreting large-scale genetic interaction networks in human cells based on genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens. In addition to computational biology, Xiang is passionate about skiing and classical music.
