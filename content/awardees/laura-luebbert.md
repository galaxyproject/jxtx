# Laura Luebbert

**CalTech**

Laura is a German-Catalan Biology Ph.D. candidate at Caltech. After earning her bachelor's and master's degrees in microbiology and biotechnology at Leiden University in The Netherlands, she followed her passion for genetics and entered the world of computational biology. Currently, she is developing a pipeline for the detection of viral sequences in next-generation sequencing data in the laboratory of Prof. Lior Pachter. She is passionate about bridging the gap between biology and bioinformatics, having worked in both wet lab and computer science roles. Her most recently published program 'gget' facilitates access to large genomic databases and has been downloaded over 30,000 times. When she is not busy detecting bugs, you can find her hiking in the San Gabriel Mountains.
