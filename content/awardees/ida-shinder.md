# Ida Shinder

**Johns Hopkins University**

Ida is a PhD candidate in the Cross Disciplinary Graduate Program in Biomedical Sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, advised by Dr. Mihaela Pertea.

Her research focuses on developing computational tools for RNA-seq analysis, with an emphasis on improving transcriptome assembly accuracy to better understand isoform diversity across tissues and conditions. By enhancing transcriptome assembly, her work aims to provide deeper insights into the complexity of gene expression and regulation in health and disease. In her free time, she enjoys hiking, practicing yoga, and playing frisbee with her Belgian Malinois.
