# Prajna Hebbar

**University of California Santa Cruz**

Prajna is a second year PhD student in the Department of Biomolecular Engineering at the University of California Santa Cruz under the supervision of Dr Benedict Paten. She is extremely interested in developing methods for comparative and pan-genomics, with a focus on gene annotation. Her most recent efforts have been to annotate the complete T2T non human primate genomes and she will soon direct her work towards helping annotate the human pangenome. Outside of work, she is an avid birder and hiker.
