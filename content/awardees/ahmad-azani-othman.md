# Ahmad Azani Othman

**UiTM**

Ahmad Azani Othman, currently in his second year of PhD studies in molecular microbiology at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Malaysia, is deeply immersed in the fascinating world of microbial diversity. His research project centers around the external and internal (gut) microbiome of blowflies collected from both Malaysia's pristine reserve forests and bustling urban areas. By employing a metagenomic approach (specifically, 16S rRNA sequencing), Ahmad aims to compare the biodiversity and intricate interplay between blowflies and bacterial populations.
