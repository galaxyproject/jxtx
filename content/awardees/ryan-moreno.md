# Ryan Moreno

**University of Wisconsin-Madison**

Ryan Moreno is a Ph.D. student in Biomedical Data Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, working under the guidance of Dr. Sushmita Roy. His research leverages evolutionary information to enhance computational analyses of gene regulation and expression.

Ryan is currently focused on an innovative project that integrates RNA sequencing data across species, with the ambitious goal of identifying both conserved and differential gene programs. This comparative approach promises to reveal fundamental principles of gene regulation that transcend species boundaries while also illuminating the evolutionary innovations that distinguish different organisms. When he's not analyzing sequencing data, Ryan enjoys playing soccer, hockey, and piano.
