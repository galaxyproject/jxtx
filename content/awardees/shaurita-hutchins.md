# Shaurita D. Hutchins

**University of Alabama-Birmingham**

Shaurita D. Hutchins is a PhD student in Genetics, Genomics, and Bioinformatics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham in the Center for Computational Genomics and Data Science and the Department of Genetics under the mentorship of Dr. Liz Worthey.

Her research focuses on identifying genetic modifiers and drug repositioning targets for Heritable Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (HPAH). Recently, she has developed web apps and tools to visualize genomic variant analyses and conduct differential gene expression studies. Outside of research, Shaurita promotes technical literacy by teaching with the Carpentries and organizing a weekly "Code, Chat, & Collab" event for bioinformatics students at UAB.
