# Amy Longtin

**Vanderbilt University**

Amy is a PhD student in Dr. Amanda Lea's lab in the Department of Biological Sciences at Vanderbilt University. Her research focuses on genotype by environment interactions and epigenetics in human and non-human primate species through the lens of evolutionary medicine. She hopes to identify the genomic and epigenomic mechanisms that embed lived experiences into physiology. Outside of the lab, she enjoys connecting with friends, cooking, and attending yoga classes.
