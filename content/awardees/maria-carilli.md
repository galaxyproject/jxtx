# Maria Carilli

**California Institute of Technology**

Maria is a PhD student in Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics at the California Institute of Technology, advised by Dr. Lior Pachter.

She researches how to gain deeper insight from single-cell omics data using statistical and machine learning-based approaches. She has worked on integrating multimodal data through biophysical modeling and is currently interested in understanding context-dependent gene regulation at the level of individual cells and cell types. Away from the computer, she enjoys long trail runs, singing in choir, and playing gigs with her band.
