# Grace Kenney

**University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill**

Grace is a second year PhD student in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and an NSF GRFP fellow at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in the lab of Dr. Doug Phanstiel. She received her BS in Biology from Truman State University and her MS in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology from Saint Louis University. Before starting her PhD, she worked as a bioinformatician at the University of Michigan's Advanced Genomics Core analyzing data from various NGS, single-cell, and spatial -omics platforms. Her research interests broadly include developing and using software for the interpretation of genetic variation and epigenetic mechanisms contributing to genome regulation.
