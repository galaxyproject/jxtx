# Sakuntha Gunarathna

**University of North Dakota**

Originally from the island nation of Sri Lanka, Sakuntha is a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Graduate Program in Biomedical Sciences at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences, working under the mentorship of Dr. Motoki Takaku.

His research focuses on using machine learning to analyze cell-free DNA (cfDNA) for non-invasive cancer detection. By leveraging open chromatin signatures in cfDNA, he develops computational models that enhance cancer prediction and biomarker discovery. His work integrates epigenomics, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence to improve the detection and characterization of breast cancer from liquid biopsies. Outside of academia, he enjoys exploring nature and astronomy, finding inspiration in both the microscopic and cosmic scales of science.
