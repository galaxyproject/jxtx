# Abdul Muntakim Rafi

**University of British Columbia**

Rafi is a Ph.D. candidate in Biomedical Engineering at the University of British Columbia. He completed his Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology and later pursued his Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Windsor.

His current research focuses on employing machine learning to design cis-regulatory models, develop methods to interpret them, and explore ways to enhance their performance, contributing to a quantitative understanding of cis-regulatory logic. Rafi has supervised multiple Co-op students in the de Boer lab and is always on the lookout for motivated undergraduates and high school students to join his research endeavors.
