# William DeGroat

**Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey**

William is an undergraduate student at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, and a member of Dr. Anat Kreimer's laboratory at the Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine. His research focuses on the development of computational methods to understand cell type-specific networks of cis-regulatory interactions and their perturbations. William has presented his findings at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and the American Society of Human Genetics. He has published open-source software in Genome Biology and Bioinformatics. William is planning to pursue a Ph.D. in computational biology and genetics.
