# Sandeep Kambhampati

**Harvard University and Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard**

Sandeep Kambhampati is a Ph.D candidate in the Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics program at Harvard University, advised by Dr. Fei Chen and Dr. Mehrtash Babadi.

His research currently focuses on building machine learning models to represent tissue organization from spatial transcriptomics data, aiming to understand how this organization forms during development and is disrupted during disease. Outside of the lab, Sandeep enjoys rock climbing and mountaineering.
