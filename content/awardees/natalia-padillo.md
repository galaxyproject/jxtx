# Natalia E. Padillo-Anthemides

**University of Florida**

Natalia is a 2nd year Genetics and Genomics PhD student in the Ryan Lab at University of Florida's Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience. Leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing while learning from generous online resources like Galaxy Training Single Cell, her project focuses on the genomics of neurons in ctenophores in order to better understand the evolution of nervous systems in animals. Natalia is eager to attend GCC to connect with fellow scholars who share her passion, deepen her understanding of how to translate knowledge into practical tools for research, and cultivate innovative analytical approaches in bioinformatics to tackle the nuanced challenges within her field.
