# Papawee Sutthirat

**University of Minnesota-Rochester & Mayo Clinic**

Papawee is a Ph.D. student in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the University of Minnesota-Rochester and a Research Technologist at the Mayo Clinic. Her research integrates computational and experimental approaches to understand liver diseases, particularly Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD) and liver cancer. She uses advanced molecular biology techniques, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, and data analysis methods to explore disease progression in both mouse models and human tissues. She is passionate about bridging computational and experimental biology to drive discoveries and therapeutic innovation.
