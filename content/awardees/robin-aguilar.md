# Robin Aguilar

**University of Washington**

Robin Aguilar is a PhD candidate and technology developer at the University of Washington in the Department of Genome Sciences. Through their research in the Beliveau and Noble labs, they develop tools and microscopy techniques that will allow researchers to understand the contributions of highly repetitive DNA in the context of global 3D genome organization, human and model organism evolution, and human disease. As they navigate their experiences in science as a queer and trans, first-gen, Latinx researcher, they are passionate about making STEM spaces more accessible and equitable for marginalized trainees. Separately, they also develop science communication workshops, curricula, and art centered on research and diverse storytelling within and beyond STEM.
