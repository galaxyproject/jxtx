# Omar Ahmed

**Johns Hopkins University**

Omar Ahmed is a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. He is advised by Dr. Ben Langmead. He obtained his BA in Computer Science and Physics from Lehigh University. Currently, his research focuses on developing novel compressed data-structures that enable rapid querying against large pan-genome collections. His recent work has been on adapting a new data-structure called the document array profiles, that enables full document listing that is independent of the size of the text, to be utilized for metagenomic read classification.
