# Zoe Rudnick

**Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine**

Zoe Rudnick is a second-year Ph.D. student in Biomedical Engineering at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Her research focuses on developing algorithms to analyze RNA-seq data, including long-read and single-cell datasets, to improve isoform-level quantification and transcript reconstruction.

Zoe's work addresses critical challenges in understanding gene expression at the transcript level, which has important implications for precision medicine and our understanding of complex biological systems. Outside of the lab, Zoe enjoys rock climbing, reading, and spending time with her cat.
