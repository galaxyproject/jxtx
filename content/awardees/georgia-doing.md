# Georgia Doing

**Hogan Lab, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth**

Georgia's research focuses on de-noising autoencoder-derived gene expression signatures for Pseudomonas aeruginosa elucidate virulence-promoting characteristics of ex vivo sputum from persons with cystic fibrosis. Her work uses machine learning to understand bacterial virulence in cystic fibrosis.
